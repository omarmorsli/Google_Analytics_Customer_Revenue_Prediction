# Google Analytics Customer Revenue Prediction

Project for the course "Data mining" (lecturer: Philippe Lenca, Romain Billot | Master DS, IMT Atlantique)

## Goal
In this competition, weâ€™re challenged to analyze a Google Merchandise Store (also known as GStore, where Google swag is sold) customer dataset to predict revenue per customer. Hopefully, the outcome will be more actionable operational changes and a better use of marketing budgets for those companies who choose to use data analysis on top of GA data.

## Dataset
The dataset was provided from a Kaggle competition. Available here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/data
